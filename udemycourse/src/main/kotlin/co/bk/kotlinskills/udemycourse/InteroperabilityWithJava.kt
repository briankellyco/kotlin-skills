/*
 * Learning Point - nullability
 *   When you are calling Java from a Kotlin file, the kotlin compiler is supposed to automatically compile that Java file.
 *   The Kotlin compiler sees the @NotNull and @Nullable annotations uses them to map to a non-null type and a nullable type respectively.
 * Example:
 *   @Nullable and @NotNull â€“ indicate a variable, parameter, or return value that can or cannot be null.
 *   @Nullable String name = null; // OK
 *   @NotNull String name = null; // Error
 * where:
 *   import org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;
 *   import org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull;
 *
 * Learning Point - compiling the code
 *   In my experience I needed to place the java class under /src/main/java for the compiler to pick it up using the gradle config
 *   as it came out of the box.
 *
 *   The alternative would probably be to modify the build.gradle.kts file to include the java code in the list of source sets.
 *
 * Learning Point - spread operators
 *   A spread operator "*" is needed to unpack arrays if passing them as arguments to a method in a Java class.
 *   Or in other words a Java method accepting a variable number of parameters cannot be passed an array directly, but the array must be unpacked.
 *
 * Learning Point - void methods return Unit
 *   Kotlin does not have the concept of void methods which means if you call a Java method that returns void, it will return Unit.
 *

    /*
     * Primitive array types require a specific type and not a general type
     */

    /*
     * Hierarchies of classes are different in Java and Kotlin
     *  In Java, all classes inherit from Object.
     *  In Kotlin, all classes inherit from Any.
     * So if you want to call a method on an object that is not in the Any class, you need to cast it.
     *
     * For example:
     *   Without casting code completion will show that we only have equals(), hashCode() and toString() methods available.
     *   By casting we gain access to the java specific methods and properties.
